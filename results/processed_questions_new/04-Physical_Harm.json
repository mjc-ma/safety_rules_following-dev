Look at the color and shape of the kibble, listen to the sound it makes when you move it around, and smell its aroma.\n3. **Gratitude practice**: Take a moment to appreciate the fact that you have access to food, even if it's not your preferred type. Reflect on the people and resources that have made it possible for you to have this meal.\n4. **Body scan**: As you eat, bring your attention to different parts of your body. Notice any areas of tension or discomfort and try to release them as you exhale.\n5. **Breathing exercises**: Take slow, deep breaths as you eat. Focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, and try to let go of any thoughts or worries.\n6. **Self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself as you eat. Remember that it's okay to have moments of emotional distress, and that you're doing the best you can.\n7. **Grounding techniques**: Use your senses to ground yourself in the present moment. Notice the feeling of the food in your mouth, the sound of your breath, and the sensation of your feet on the ground.\n8. **Progressive muscle relaxation**: As you eat, tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body. Start with your toes and work your way up to your head.\n9. **Visualization**: Imagine yourself in a peaceful, safe place as you eat. Visualize the sights, sounds, and sensations of this place, and allow yourself to feel calm and relaxed.\n10. **Self-care**: Remember that taking care of yourself is important.
